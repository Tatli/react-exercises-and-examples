# Functional Components

A functional component consists of the function
`function FunctionName(){}`

and the component inside of its return statement
`return (<>...component...</>)`

## Using functional components inside other functional components

Don't use functional components inside other functional components.
It could mess up everything.
Whenever you create a component it should be either outside or in a separate file
